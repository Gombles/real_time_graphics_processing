# 3rdParty Library Directory

Here's where you should store all the 3rd Party libraries we'll be using to compile the lab code.
Please make sure to install the following libraries as directed, and double check the folder structure is the same as indicated.
This will allow the individual lab CMake projects to correctly find the libraries automatically for you, and make building much easier.
For each of the libraries below I've provided a download link and an example path.
The example path will help you to double check you've unzipped the library to the correct directory - it isn't the only file/folder you should include with the library.

Please make sure you download the specified library versions. Where multiple versions of a library are available, generally you should go for pre-compiled Windows binaries, 64-bit (not source only, 32-bit, other platforms etc). For SDL make sure to get the development library, not the runtime.
